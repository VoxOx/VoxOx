  eXosip is now quite stable. However, eXosip is not as extensible
  and powerfull as I was expecting at the beguining. This is why
  you should be aware that this version and API will probably be
  completely obselete and replaced with a future eXosip2 in some
  time.

  eXosip is an extension of osip. It won't be considered stable and safe
  until this file mention it or until this notice is removed!!
