To update the ffmpeg compilation process with this project:

	-> You need an Intel and a PPC Macintosh;
	-> Have the ffmeg sources on both computer;
	-> Launch configure on each computer;
	-> Copy config.h and config.mak files from each computer
		in the config/mac/$ARCH directory of the project;
	-> Remove SRC_PATH variables from each config.mak (the correct SRC_PATH is
		given by the XCode compile scripts);

That's it, you can now compile a Universal Binary version of FFMPEG
