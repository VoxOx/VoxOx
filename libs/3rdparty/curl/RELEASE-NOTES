 o CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY is now deprecated
 o --ftp-ssl-ccc and CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC were added
 o HTTP support for non-ASCII platforms
 o --libcurl was added

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o proxy close during CONNECT authentication is now dealt with nicely
 o the CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION was sometimes called even when CURLOPT_VERBOSE
   was not enabled
 o multiple TFTP transfers on the same (easy or multi) handle could cause a
   crash
 o SIGSEGV when disconnecting on a transfer on a re-used handle when the
   host name didn't resolve
 o stack overwrite on 64bit Windows in the chunked decoding department
 o HTTP responses on persistent connections without Content-Length nor chunked
   encoding are now considered to be without response body
 o Content-Range: header parsing improved
 o CPU 100% load when HTTP upload connection broke
 o active FTP didn't work with multi interface
 o curl_getdate() could be off one hour for TZ time zones with DST, on windows
 o CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE works again
 o CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS set to zero caused libcurl to SIGSEGV
 o rate limiting works better
 o getting FTP response code errors when using the multi-interface caused
   libcurl to leak memory
 o no more SIGPIPE when GnuTLS is used
 o FTP downloading 2 zero byte files in a row
 o using proxy and URLs without protocol prefixes
 o first using a proxy and then accessing a site that 'no_proxy' matched,
   would still make libcurl use the proxy...
 o curl_easy_duphandle() now makes a handle that is valid for the multi
   interface since the magic number is set fine
 o libcurl.pc now uses Libs.private for "private" libs
 o --limit-rate (CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE)
   now work on windows again
 o improved download performance by avoiding the unconditional "double copying"
 o base64 encoding/decoding works on non-ASCII platforms
 o large file downloads
 o CURLOPT_COOKIELIST set to "ALL" crash
 o easy handle removal from multi handle before completion
 o TFTP upload memory leak
 o curl_easy_reset() now resets the CA bundle path correctly
 o two User-Agent headers in CONNECT requests with custom User-Agent
