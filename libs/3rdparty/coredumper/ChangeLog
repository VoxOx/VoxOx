	* coredumper: initial release:
	  The coredumper utility allows a running program to generate a
	  core file without actually crashing.  This serves to allow the
	  programmer to generate a snapshot of a running program's state
	  at any time.

	* coredumper: version 0.2 release
	* fixed compilation on icc (simonb)
	* added a new WriteCoreDumpLimited() function that allows the
