%description
Inter Asterisk eXchange, lovingly called IAX (pronounced: eeks), is the protocol used by the Asterisk PBX
system for inter-asterisk-communication.  Other applications may use libiax to communicate with each other
and other asterisk servers.  IAX is a high performance, feature rich protocol unrelated
to SIP or H.323.  Its single-socket design allows it to interoperate with NAT and PAT
masquerade firewalls.  It supports internationalization, remote dialplans, 
and voice, HTML, image, DTMF, and video content.  For more information see
