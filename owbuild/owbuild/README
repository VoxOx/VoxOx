Coding Recommendations
----------------------

* Be very careful about the API and the design: goal is not to
create an ugly hack above CMake but a complete/simple/powerful build system

* Do not use spaces, use tabs

* 1 function/macro = 1 file

* Documentation always follows this shape:

# - name_of_the_function()
# One line explanation
#
# Full explanation from a user point of vue
#
# Example:
#
# Output Generated:
#
# Explanation about the internal way it works
#
# Copyright (C) 2007  Your Firstname and Lastname <your@email>

# Redistribution and use is allowed according to the terms of the BSD license.
# For details see the accompanying COPYING file.
