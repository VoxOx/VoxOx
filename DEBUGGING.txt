# Adjusting log output

The WengoPhone logs in different components and provides 5 log levels:
- 0: Debug
- 1: Info
- 2: Warn
- 3: Error
- 4: Fatal

By default, only messages whose level more or equal to Info will get output. You
can change this globally or on a component basis through environment variables.

## Changing the global log level
This is done with the OWLOGGER_DEFAULT variable. Set it to 0 to get all possible
log output.

## Changing the log level of a component
This is done by adjusting the OWLOGGER_<COMPONENT_IN_UPPER_CASE> variable.
For example to get debug output from PhApi, set OWLOGGER_PHAPI to 0.

To get a list of available components, run this command from the base source
dir.

	grep -h -r --include '*.cpp' LOGGER_COMPONENT . | sort | uniq

For code which does not define a specific component, the default component is
"Common".
